# Durango Family Ski Adventure - Thanksgiving Week

## The Family
- 50-year-old married couple (active, decent shape - walking, pilates, push-ups)
- 13-year-old athletic son (elite swimmer, parkour enthusiast)
- Minimal skiing experience (parents skied once as teenagers, son never)
- Austin-based with friend in Durango offering local guidance

## Overall Approach
Frame this as a "Colorado mountain adventure week" with skiing as one exciting activity rather than the main focus. This reduces pressure and provides alternatives if skiing doesn't click for everyone.

## 5-Day Itinerary

### Day 1 - Arrival & Mountain Acclimatization
- Arrive and settle into accommodations
- Explore downtown Durango
- Easy hike along Animas River Trail (flat, scenic, perfect for stretching travel legs)
- Evening: Dinner downtown, early rest to adjust to altitude

### Day 2 - Ski Day
- Full day at Purgatory Resort with local friend as guide
- Start with lessons and easy slopes
- Assess comfort levels - continue skiing or head back for recovery
- Perfect introduction with expert local knowledge

### Day 3 - Horseback & History
- Morning: Winter horseback riding at Rapp Corral (beautiful snowy landscapes)
- Afternoon: Mesa Verde National Park (45-minute drive to ancient cliff dwellings)
- Combines adventure with cultural education

### Day 4 - Adventure & Recovery
- Morning options:
  - Zip-lining at Soaring Tree Top Adventures (ideal for parkour enthusiast)
  - Snowshoeing for a mellower mountain experience
- Afternoon: Pagosa Hot Springs (1-hour drive) for muscle recovery and mountain views
- Overnight in Pagosa Springs or return to Durango

### Day 5 - Scenic Farewell
- Morning: Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad (winter scenic train ride through canyons)
- Afternoon: Final Durango exploration and departure

## Weather Expectations (Thanksgiving Week)

### Temperatures
- **Daytime highs:** 42-55°F (can reach 60°F on nice days)
- **Nighttime lows:** Low 20s (below freezing)
- **Daily variation:** Can swing 30+ degrees due to altitude

### Conditions
- **Unpredictable:** Range from September-like weather to full winter conditions
- **November snow average:** 5.5 inches in town
- **Higher elevations:** Expect snow at ski areas

### Packing Essentials
- Layering system (base layers, fleece, waterproof shell)
- Warm accessories (hats, gloves, scarves)
- Snow boots or hiking boots with good traction
- Both warm and moderate weather clothing options

## Why This Works

**For the Parents:**
- Mixed activity levels accommodate fitness without overwhelming
- Built-in recovery time between active days
- Cultural and scenic elements beyond just physical activities

**For the Athletic Teen:**

- Adventure balanced with family time

**For Everyone:**

## Key Advantages of Durango

## Backup Plans
Weather unpredictability makes the mixed-activity approach ideal - indoor and alternative outdoor options ensure a successful trip regardless of conditions.
